# Warships

It is my first object oriented programming project. 
Slight modification of well known game Battleships/Sea battle. Rules are basically the same:
- You cannot place ships diagonally
- Ships can't touch each other
- Ships cannot be placed on top of each other

It is a console game, with possibility of further development thanks to the use of objects. DisplayCmd class can be easily replaced. Also, types and quantity of ships can be changed any time.
